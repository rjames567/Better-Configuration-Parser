# Better Configuration Parser
This module provides the ConfigParser class, which implements a configuration langauge. This configuration language is based upon the .ini format used by Windows, which can then be used to easily configure programs.

It is designed to be used instead of the Puthon configparser module, following the TOML format, with the addditional interpolation supported by configparser.
